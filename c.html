<h3>Climate and Ecology of Madhya Pradesh</h3></div>
<div class="w3-container w3-khaki">
<p>Madhya Pradesh has a subtropical climate. Like most of north India, it has a hot dry summer (April�June), followed by monsoon rains (July�September) and a cool and relatively dry winter. The average rainfall is about 1,371 mm (54.0 in). It decreases from east to west because monsoon wind moves from east to west and drained clouds in eastern parts takes less quantity of water vapours with them to western parts. The south-eastern districts have the heaviest rainfall, some places receiving as much as 2,150 mm (84.6 in), while the western and north-western districts receive 1,000 mm (39.4 in) or less.

It constitutes 12.30% of the forest area of India. Legally this area has been classified into "Reserved Forest" (65.3%), "Protected Forest" (32.84%) and "Unclassified Forest" (0.18%).

Red and yellow soil, in Baghelkhand region
